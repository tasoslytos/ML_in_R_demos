#' Our improvement from decreasing bias will eventually level off.
#' This shows there are limits to gains from complexity, and these
#' are based on the complexity of the function being modelled. In
#' our fourth order polynomial example adding higher orders could
#' only add noise, since the function itself was a noisy fourth
#' order polynomial.
#'
#' Choosing a point below the optimal means you are underfitting:
#' The complexity of the model is insufficient to optimally model
#' the function.
#'
#' Choosing a point above the optimal means you are overfitting:
#' The complexity of the model is too high for the amount of data
#' and/or the function to support and you are fitting to noise
#' in the data.
#'
#'
#' Concerns on complexity of the model
#'
#' What is a good measure of complexity?
#' For linear models, the number of parameters is a good measure.
#' For non-linear models, this is sometimes problematic.
#'
#' For example, assuming distinct Y for identical X, a non-linear
#' function of the form y_hat=a+b*cos(c*x) can fit any data
#' *perfectly*! And a is only required if there are any cases
#' where x=0
#'
#' ML = Maximum Likelihood, here calculated assuming Gaussian noise
#'    = Parameters that maximize the probability of seeing the data
#'    given the model type.

y=c(-2.87,0.07,1.9,2.47,2.91)
df=data.frame(x=x,y=y)                      # a dataframe with x and y models
plot(x,y,main="2 parameter ML OLS model")   # Ordinary Least Squares
model=lm(y~x,df)
plot(function(x)predict(model,data.frame(x=x)),from=0,to=10,add=T)

# Pause for a moment

f=function(x)3*cos(10*x)
plot(f,from=0,to=10,n=1000,add=T)
#' Still, the number of parameters is often a reasonably good choice,
#' and let us think in these terms for now.

#' Shallow Neural Network,
